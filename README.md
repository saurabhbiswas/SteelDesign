## Design of Steel Structure with STAAD Pro

The Theory at the back of the design of Steel Structure is usually taught during B.E. /B. Tech program in Civil Engineering and its allied discipline like M.E. /M. Tech in Structural Engineering. Practical implementation of these theory to actual design of structure to be constructed, strengthened or modified remains a hurdle to freshly passed out engineers , many a times to experienced engineers as well. The author of this write up has put up his experience of “One Quarter Century “of professional practice, to showcase the design of building with two floors with flat roof for office uses, to which a single storied warehouse or work shop is attached, using STAAD Pro V8i software, Select Series 6 of Bentley and explained implementation of various code specified provisions (the provision of IS codes), both to analysis and design. Thus the design methodology used in this write up can be extended to both multistoried Steel structure as well as pre‐engineered Ware house type Steel buildings.
